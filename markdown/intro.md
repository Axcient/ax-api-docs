    Welcome to the x360Recover Public API. 
    
    An API (Application Programming Interface) allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. Our API exposes various endpoints that enable developers to leverage our services programmatically. Explore the available endpoints below to start your integration. The Public API is in Early Access and endpoints are subject to change.  As we move out of early access, endpoints will become versioned and we will make a best effort to maintain backwards compatability.  Our API is free for partners and vendors to consume and you can get started by calling our Mock Servers.
    
    **API Key Creation:** Authorization uses the header based format of x-api-key.  Keys can be created from within the Settings section of the x360Portal. To find information on how to create API keys, visit [help.axcient.com](https://help.axcient.com) for detailed screenshots.
    
    **Mock Servers:** If you want to test against mock servers, use [https://ax-pub-recover.wiremockapi.cloud/](https://ax-pub-recover.wiremockapi.cloud/) as your base URL.  The Mock servers validate that you are sending the **x-api-header** but do not validate content.
